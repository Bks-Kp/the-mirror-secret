    const intro = `Kalpana is trapped inside an abandoned mansion where every mirror reflects an 
    alternate reality. Each reflection shows a world that feels familiar — 
    yet twisted by secrets she cannot remember.

    The walls whisper her name.
    Footsteps echo in empty corridors where time stands still.
    Every mirror calls out to her — promising truth, or tempting her with lies.

    To escape, Kalpana must choose which reflections to trust.
    Each wrong choice steals a fragment of her soul... each right one draws her closer to the truth.

    Somewhere beyond the final mirror lies the reason she was brought here,
    and the name that binds her to the mansion’s curse.

    Her journey begins now.`;
